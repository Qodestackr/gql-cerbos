One of the defacto standards of tackling how decoupled systems interact together is by building APIs. In recent years, GraphQL has gained popularity in developing web APIs. GraphQL spec uses a declarative query language that favors flexible queries to your client's demands. On the backend, you create a strongly typed schema to resolve data so the clients can send arbitrary queries for the exact data they want, which you will validate against your schema.

However, building GraphQL APIs differs from architectural styles like REST. In REST, everything is a resource defined by a URL. The REST architecture leverages stateless operations such as `POST,` `PUT,` `GET,` and `DELETE.` When we need to combine data from multiple endpoints in REST, we run numerous roundtrip requests making it inflexible. On the other hand, GraphQL exposes a single endpoint to query and mutate system resources.

This article will share some standard best practices for implementing access control patterns in GraphQL APIs.

### Authorization in GraphQL

One of the vital components in securing enterprise applications is Authorization. For security reasons, the business APIs we build need mechanisms for access control to the end-users to grant permissions and action privileges on the infrastructure. However, unlike the REST APIs environment, where we mainly have a single entry point for Authorization, the GraphQL [spec](http://spec.graphql.org/) is un-opinionated about how we implement Authorization as developers. 

For flexibility, GraphQL ensures that we have ad-hoc requests, and therefore we can have multiple layers where we can delegate Authorization, such as field resolvers, data layer, etc. Furthermore, GraphQL gives the client the freedom to submit arbitrary queries. Hence Authorization needs to be dynamic and flexible. In the next section, dive into various methods of handling authorization logic in a GraphQL API.

### Ways of implementing Authorization in GraphQL

In Node.js, we have fine-grained options such as `apollo-server,` `express-graphql,` or `graphql-js.` This development will use `express-graphql.`
To complete this setup, you will need:
- Development system with Node.js environment
- Basic JavaScript and GraphQL knowledge
- MongoDB or use [atlas]()

<!-- Link a repository on your GitHub [get it from (https://github.com/Qodestackr/gql-cerbos)] for starter code && provide its structure(models, schema, & index.js entry point) -->

<!-- Talk about schema.js file that consists resolvers too::
A typical GraphQL API consists of schemas and resolvers.
Schema has type definitions with expected fields.
Each field maps a function which is known as a resolver.
The resolver will contain the logic to return the data you defined in schemas.
 -->

<!-- Next, run `npm install`. -->

#### API-wide authorization

API-wide Authorization is commonly referred to as the all-or-nothing approach since it permits or restricts access to the entire API. Immediately we receive a request from the client; we can revoke the ability to execute a query based on the role. Here is an example that will only allow API access when the user role is admin:

js
async function getAllProjects(req, res, next){
  const token = req.headers.authorization || ''
  const user = loadUser(token) // load user with the token
  if(user.role!=='admin') throw new Error('not authorized')
  // logic to fetch && display all projects
  // ...

  const projects = await Project.findById(args.id)
  return projects

}


We can drop this as a middleware in our Express application at the top level. This approach is functional when the API has less public access. However, this approach locks queries making our API inflexible when we need to implement field-level accessibility. 

#### Authorization in Query & Mutation Resolvers

Resolvers are functions that define how we perform actions against your data from the fields on the type definitions. GraphQL offers granular control over data. We can therefore build individual field resolvers with the ability to check user roles that connect schema with data store & make decisions on what to return for each user.

Unlike the API-wide approach, implementing Authorization on the resolvers offers enormous flexibility. We have the logic close to the components the end-users will interact with. All we need is to grant queries and mutations based on roles. When developing large systems, we reduce the baggage of hunting down the logic that "keeps users out." However, there may be a drawback of repeated code across multiple resolvers.


A resolver is a javaScript function that accepts four arguments: root or parent, args, context, and info. The context is passed to each resolver and contains data initialized at the request level. And therefore, we can store metadata about the user making the request. 

From our `RootQuery,` the resolver returns all projects as:

```js
const RootQuery = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'RootQueryType',
  fields: {
    projects: {
      type: new GraphQLList(ProjectType),
      resolve(parent, args, context, info) {
        return Project.find();
      },
    }
  },
})

```
To add Authorization, modify the project resolvers so that only users with role admin can access:

```js
const project = require('../models/Projects') // The MongoDB model

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    // pull user from the context and check if the role is [admin]
    projects: async(_, args, {user}, info) =>{
      if(user && user.role !=='admin'){
      throw new Erro("not authorized")
    }
    const projects = await Project.findById(args.id)
    return projects
    }
  }
}
module.exports = resolvers

```


#### Pros
1. Approach only works best when the API has fewer general queries.

2. Since resolvers are simple functions that return data, they do not care about the structure of the underlying datastore.


#### Cons
1. Tedious since we need to write authorization checks on every resolver, replicating logic.
2. It can get messy with complex roles and schemas. 
   

#### Delegating authorization to models. 

One of the most adopted approaches is keeping our resolvers as dumb as possible so that access can be relegated to the code that fetches the data. This approach does not need to replicate logic that grabs entities across multiple resolvers.

You can add Authorization for the `ProjectType` as:

```js

// Project Type
const ProjectType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Project',
  fields: () => ({
    id: { type: GraphQLID },
    name: { type: GraphQLString },
    description: { type: GraphQLString },
    status: { type: GraphQLString },
    client: {
      type: ClientType,
      resolve(parent, context, args) {
        if (context.user.role === 'admin') {
          return Project.findById(parent.clientId)
        }
        else{
          return null;
        }
        
      }
    },
  }),
})

```


This way, Authorization will always map to the current object against the models rather than resolved Scalar fields. On the `ProjectType,` the model layer accepts the user object from the context to determine the role.


### Pros
1. Allows granular field-level permissions where a client with the role `admin` could see certain fields while a client with the role `viewer` cannot. For example, we can add a price field to our `Projects` model, which is only accessible by admins, so that normal users can still query and get a response to other fields.
2. All our business logic is placed in a single place, independent of your resolvers and schema. 
   
### Cons
1. This approach does not allow us to know authorization rules at a high level when we need to return early.
2. It Becomes complicated to abstract authorization rules into middleware patterns, thereby denying reusability.
3. Having Authorization is ideal for reading data but becomes cumbersome when enforcing rules to write it.


#### Authorization using Cerbos ABAC system

At scale, the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) approach becomes inflexible since we need to duplicate a lot of functional hierarchy in a system where access roles change often. Organizations with multiple departments, such as sales, IT, marketing, and HR, need specific rules, and system administrators often get the cumbersome task of defining permissions. Furthermore, the tightly coupled model becomes cumbersome to redesign over time. 

Another alternative is implementing Attribute-Based Access Control. Our access model provides security rules applied as object attributes with this approach. These attributes act as scope metadata to infer whether the user should be granted specific actions against the resource. It favors configuration over code to approach where we can define roles of various users such as developers, sales, marketing, product manager, or HR in a human-readable definition language.

One of the popular tools is Cerbos. Cerbos is a cloud-native and open-source tool that allows us to offload tedious authorization decisions from backend services to a dedicated provider. Decoupling this logic is as easy as setting up a configuration that is language agnostic to guarantee consistency across multiple services.

#### Implementing Cerbos in GraphQL
The easiest way to get started with Cerbos API is via the Docker runtime. From docker, run the container as:
```bash

docker run --rm --name cerbos -p 3592:3592 ghcr.io/cerbos/cerbos:0.17.0
```

Next, add the `cerbos` package from NPM as:
```bash
npm install cerbos
```
Cerbos needs policies and config files. To add them, create a `cerbos` folder inside the `server` folder. Our cerbos folder will need two more directories: config and policies. The policies directory will contain a `policies.yml` file that includes a readable YML format that defines actions on the system. Create `policies.yml` and add the code:
```yml
---
# point to API version
apiVersion: api.cerbos.dev/v1

# resoucePolicy is the business logic that states actions, conditions, and roles
resourcePolicy: 
  version: default
  resource: Project
  rules:
    - actions: ["read", "create"]
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles:
      - admin
      - user
    - actions: ["update", "delete"]
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles:
        - admin

    - actions: ["update", "delete"]
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles:
        -user
      condition:
        match: 
          expr: request.resource.attr.owner == request.principal.id
          # Allowed only if you are the owner of the resource
```

The `conf.yml` file points our server to the port, storage, and policies. The `conf.yml` file looks like this:

```yml
---
server:
  httpListenAddr: ":3592"
storage: 
  driver: "disk"
  disk: 
    directory: /policies

```

Next, create an instance of Cerbos with the port to listen. In our case, we point the server on `localhost:3592`. 

```js
const {Cerbos} = require('cerbos')
const cerbosInstance = new Cerbos({
  hostname: "http://localhost:3592",
})
```

```js
const permissions = await cerbosInstance.check({
  principal: {
    id: req.user.id,
    roles: req.user.roles,
    attr: req.user
  },
  resource: {
    kind: "project",
    instances: {
      [project.id]: {
        attr: project
      }
    }
  },
  actions: ["update"]
  // await updateProject
  // This will return an either allow or deny
  // do policy check if authorized to perform action [update]::
  if(!permissions.isAuthorized(project.id, "update")){ res.status(403).json({msg: "forbidden"}) }

  // else update if attributes match
  await updateProject(project, req.body)
  res.status(200).json({status: "ok", data: project})
})

```

#### Pros
1. Since developers or system administrators only focus on configuration over code, we have a central point to manage your authorization logic across all applications and services.
 
2. With Cerebos, you can quickly test your authorization policies or add configuration and CI/CD workflows during the deployment phase. Furthermore, we can have multiple attributes and permissions from a resource making the ABAC approach dynamic.
 
3. Cerebos works seamlessly with other identity provider services like Auth0 and Okta.
 
4. Cerebos provides a simple-to-use API that works with most modern stacks, including microservices to cloud infrastructure. With Cerebos, we do not have to constantly change our backend code if the business logic needs to be changed.

#### Cons
1. Since most applications do not need access policies at the data layer, security enforcement becomes cumbersome when enforcing policies in systems where database access and interfaces are needed.

2. Authorization as a Service tool like Cerebos may have higher maintenance when auditing permissions.

### Conclusion
Crafting your GraphQL APIs with Authorization is critical in securing your applications. For modern tech stacks where managing roles in stateless systems is crucial, Cerebos offers an open-source, permission, and context-aware API that integrates with any design to replace redundant and complex code.
